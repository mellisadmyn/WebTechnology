            <p align="justify"> 
                First aid is the initial assistance given to someone that is injured or has become unwell 
                until further medical assistance arrives. First Aid knowledge is invaluable for both you as 
                the individual and for social community. It can be applied in the home, the workplace, or in 
                public locations. Therefore, the more people with First Aid knowladge are in a community, 
                the safer that community becomes.

            <p align="justify"> 
                Having First Aid knowladge not only benefits you as an individual but it extends to your family, 
                friends, co-workers and even the community as a whole. As unpleasant as it is to talk about, 
                accidents and emergency situations are not completely preventable or unavoidable. 
                If an accident happens in the workplace, in your home or in a public space, being a helpless witness 
                to an emergency situation can potentially worsen the situation.
